    <h1>Ethan Young</h1>
    <p>
        I built this site as a hobby and a learning experience. Yes, I am a big enough nerd to want to build a website on the weekends for fun.

            This section contains pictures from some of the trips I've taken. Most of them involve skiing and motorcycle touring: my two main hobbies.

            I'm a software developer with experience using .NET, Go, Java, and Node.js technologies. I'll keep my resume up to date when I'm actively looking for a job,
            but it may get out of date when I'm only passively looking.
